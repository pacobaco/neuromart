# Neuro-Mining Cryptocurrency Ecosystem

This is a minimal proof of concept for a neuro-mining cryptocurrency ecosystem. The system rewards users with NeuroTokens based on their EEG brainwave activity, such as focus (Gamma waves) or relaxation (Theta waves).

## Key Features
- **EEG Data Collection**: Collects brainwave data (Gamma, Theta) from EEG devices.
- **Smart Contract**: ERC-20 token (NeuroToken) deployed on Ethereum testnet.
- **Reward System**: Users are rewarded NeuroTokens based on focus and relaxation thresholds.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses `web3.py` for token transfer between users' wallets.
- **Web Interface**: Basic HTML/JS frontend to display token balance and enable token transfers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Web3.py library
- Ethereum testnet (e.g., Rinkeby)
- MetaMask or other Ethereum wallet
- EEG device (e.g., OpenBCI, Muse) for real data

## Installation & Setup

1. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   - Use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or [Hardhat/Truffle](https://hardhat.org/) to deploy the NeuroToken contract to Ethereum testnet (Rinkeby).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install web3
   ```

3. **Connect EEG Device**:
   - Integrate with real EEG devices (e.g., OpenBCI, Muse) using their APIs to collect brainwave data.

4. **Run Blockchain Integration**:
   - Use the provided Python scripts for sending and receiving tokens based on brainwave evaluation.

5. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Deploy the provided HTML/JS interface to allow user interactions with the blockchain and display NeuroToken balances.

## Usage
1. Launch the system and connect the EEG device.
2. Monitor EEG data (Gamma and Theta waves).
3. Receive tokens based on your focus and relaxation state.
4. Interact with the web interface to send and receive NeuroTokens.
